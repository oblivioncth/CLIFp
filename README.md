# CLIFp (Command-line Interface for Flashpoint)
<img align="left" src="https://i.imgur.com/U6aDFSt.png" width=20%>

CLIFp (pronounced "Cliff-P") is a command-line interface for [BlueMaxima's Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/) project that allows starting games/animations from within the collection via a system's command parser and contextual arguments. While it is a separate application, CLIFp functions closely to that of a native CLI by parsing the configuration of the Flashpoint install it is deployed into and therefore launches games/animation in the same manner as the standard GUI launcher.

Other than a few pop-up dialogs used for alerts and errors, CLIFp runs completely in the background so that the only windows seen during use are the same ones present while running standard Flashpoint. It automatically terminates once the target application has exited, requiring no manual tasks or clean-up by the user. 

[![Dev Builds](https://github.com/oblivioncth/CLIFp/actions/workflows/push-reaction.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/oblivioncth/CLIFp/actions/workflows/push-reaction.yml)

## Compatability
### General
Because it directly mimics the actions of the GUI launcher, CLIFp should provide a perfect or near-perfect experience when compared to using the standard method of launching games/animations. Additionally, this makes it fairly resilient towards Flashpoint updates and will most likely only require compatibility patches when updates that make major changes are released.

All Flashpoint features are supported, other than editing the local database and querying title meta-data through the command-line. More specifically, one can launch:

 - Games (with or without autorun-before additional apps)
 - Animations
 - Additional Apps (including messages)
 - Extras
 - Anything else I'm forgetting

While testing for complete compatibility is infeasible given the size of Flashpoint, CLIFp was designed with full compatibility in mind and theoretically is 100% compatible with the Flashpoint collection. Games are slightly prioritized when it comes to testing the application however.

### Version Matching
Each release of this application targets a specific version series of BlueMaximaâ€™s Flashpoint, which are composed of a major and minor version number, and are designed to work with all Flashpoint updates within that series. For example, a FIL release that targets Flashpoint 10.1 is intended to be used with any version of flashpoint that fits the scheme `10.1.x.x`, such as `10.1`, `10.1.0.3`, `10.1.2`, etc, but **not**  `10.2`.

Using a version of CLIFp with a version of Flashpoint different than its target version is discouraged as some features may not work correctly or at all and in some cases the utility may fail to function entirely; **however**, given its design, CLIFp is likely to continue working with newer versions of FP that are released without requiring an update, unless that new version contains significant technical changes.

The title of each [release](https://stackedit.io/github.com/oblivioncth/CLIFp/releases) will indicate which version of Flashpoint it targets.

Updates will always be set to target the latest Flashpoint release, even if they were not created explicitly for compatibility reasons.

## Usage
### Target Usage
CLIFp was primarily created for use with its sister project [FIL (Flashpoint Importer for Launchers)](https://github.com/oblivioncth/FIL) to facilitate the inclusion of Flashpoint in to LaunchBox and other frontend collections. The operation of CLIFp is completely automated when used in this manner.

It was later refined to also be used directly with the Flashpoint project to allow users to create shortcuts and leverage other benefits of a CLI. 

That being said, it is perfectly possible to use CLIFp in any manner one sees fit.

It is recommended to place CLIFp in the root directory of Flashpoint (next to its shortcut), but CLIFp will search all parent directories in order for the root Flashpoint structure and therefore will work correctly in any Flashpoint sub-folder. However, this obviously won't work if CLIFp is behind a symlink/junction.

### General
**NOTE: Do not run CLIFp as an administrator/root as some titles may not work correctly or run at all**

CLIFp uses the following syntax scheme:

    CLIFp <global options> *command* <command options>
The order of switches within each options section does not matter.


**Primary Usage:**
The most common use case is the **play** command with the **-i** switch, followed by the UUID of a Flashpoint title:

    CLIFp play -i 37e5c215-9c39-4a3d-9912-b4343a17027e

This is the most straightforward and hassle free approach, as it will start that title exactly as if it had been launched from the Flashpoint GUI (including download/mounting of data packs, autorun before additional apps, etc.).

A title's ID can be found by right clicking on an entry in Flashpoint and selecting "Copy Game UUID". This command also supports starting additional apps, though getting their UUID is more tricky as I currently know of no other way than opening [FP Install Dir]\Data\flashpoint.sqlite in a database browser and searching for the ID manually. I will look into if an easier way to obtain their IDs can be implemented.

Alternatively, the **-t** switch can be used, followed by the exact title of an entry:

    CLIFp play -t "Interactive Buddy"

Or if feeling spontanious, use the **-r** switch, followed by a library filter to select a title randomly:

    CLIFp play -r game

See the full command/options list for more information.

**Direct Execution:**
The legacy approach is to use the **run** command with the **--app** and **--param** switches. This will start Flashpoint's webserver and then start the application specified with the provided parameters:

    CLIFp run --app="FPSoftware\Flash\flashplayer_32_sa.exe" --param="http://www.mowa.org/work/buttons/buttons_art/basic.swf"

If the application needs to use files from a Data Pack that pack will need to be downloaded/mounted first using **prepare** or else it won't work.

The applications and arguments that are used for each game/animation can be found within the Flashpoint database ([FP Install Dir]\Data\flashpoint.sqlite)

## All Commands/Options
The recommended way to use all switches is to use their short form when the value for the switch has no spaces:

    -i 95b149c2-7f57-4894-b980-6ef03192f79d

and the long form when the value does have spaces

    --msg="I am a message"
though this isn't required as long as quotation and space use is carefully employed.

### Global Options:
 -  **-h | --help | -?:** Prints usage information
 -  **-v | --version:** Prints the current version of the tool
 -  **-q | --quiet:** Silences all non-critical messages
 -  **-s | --silent:** Silences all messages (takes precedence over quiet mode)
 
### Commands:
**link** - Creates  a  shortcut  to  a  Flashpoint  title

Options:
 -  **-i | --id:** UUID  of  title  to  make a shortcut for
 -  **-t | --title:** Title to  make a shortcut for
 -  **-p | --path:** Path to new shortcut. Path's ending with ".lnk" (Windows) or ".desktop" (Linux) will be interpreted as a named shortcut file. Any other path will be interpreted as a directory and the title will automatically be used as the filename

Requires:
**-i** or **-t** 

Notes: 

 - On Linux, when providing a full shortcut path via the **--path** switch, the filename component is re-interpreted as the shortcut's display name and the actual filename is set automatically.



   For example, when specifying:
   
       CLIFp link -p "~/Desktop/Cool Name.desktop" ...

   the display name of the desktop entry will be set to "Cool Name".
 - On some Linux desktop environments (i.e. GNOME) the shortcut might need to manually be set to "trusted" in order to be used and displayed correctly after it is created. This option is usually available in the file's right-click context menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**play** - Launch  a  title  and  all  of  it's  support  applications,  in  the  same  manner  as  using  the  GUI

Options:

 -  **-i | --id:** UUID  of  title  to  start
 -  **-t | --title:** Title  to  start
 - **-r | --random:** Select  a  random  title  from  the  database  to  start.  Must  be  followed  by  a  library  filter:  all/any,  game/arcade,  animation/theatre
 -  **-h | --help | -?:** Prints command specific usage information

Requires:
**-i** or **-t** or **-r** 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 **prepare** - Initializes  Flashpoint  for  playing  the  provided  Data  Pack  based  title  by  UUID.  If  the  title  does  not  use  a  Data  Pack  this  command  has  no  effect.

Options:

 -  **-i | --id:** UUID  of  title  to  prepare
 -  **-t | --title:** Title  to  prepare
 -  **-h | --help | -?:** Prints command specific usage information

Requires:
**-i** or **-t** 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 **run** - Start  Flashpoint's  webserver  and  then  execute  the  provided  application

Options:
  -  **-a | --app:** Relative (to Flashpoint Directory) path of  application to launch
 -  **-p | --param:** Command-line parameters to use when starting the application

Requires:
**-a** 

Notes: 

When using the **--exe** and **--param** switches all quotes that are part of the input itself must be escaped for the command to be passed correctly. For example, the launch command

    "http://website.com" -switch "value"
  must be specified as
  

    --param="\"http://website.com\" -switch \"value\""
   Additionally, any characters with special meaning to the Windows shell that are not within at least one level of quote pairs must also be escaped (this can be avoided as long as you wrap the entire value of the switch in quotes as shown above):

    http://website.com/foo&bar => --param=http://website.com/foo^&bar

See http://www.robvanderwoude.com/escapechars.php for more information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 **show** - Display  a  message  or  extra  folder

Options:
 -  **-m | --msg:** Displays an pop-up dialog with the supplied message. Used primarily for some additional apps
 -  **-e | --extra:** Opens an explorer window to the specified extra. Used primarily for some additional apps

Requires:
**-m** or **-e** 

### Remarks
With any use of the **--title** option for the commands that support it the title must be entered verbatim as it appears within Flashpoint, as close matches are not checked (due to technical limitations). If two entries happen to share the title specified, a dialog window with more information will be displayed so that the intended title can be selected.

## Other Features
CLIFp displays a system tray icon so that one can be sure it is still running. This icon also will display basic status messages when clicked on and features a context menu with an option to exit at any time.

The functionality of the tray icon may be expanded upon in future releases.

## Exit Codes
Once CLIFp has finished executing an exit code is reported that indicates the "error status" of the program, which can be useful for recording/determining issues. The exit code can be obtained by running the application in the following manner, or by examining CLIFp.log:

    start /wait CLIFp.exe [parameters]
    echo %errorlevel%
